# AI Encode Course - Week 1 weekend project

During the first week of the course, we saw a few applications in Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Specifically, Neural Networks, LLMs, the uses of Transformers, and more importantly, OpenAI.

OpenAI has incredibly made things easier for everyone as the pre-trained models have served as the based for many incredible projects.

The current project is based on OpenAI and how well we can apply the chat `prompts` to customise our outcomes in the different scripts.

The project will allow the user to execute different scripts that will prompt them to ask for recipes, and dish names and criticize a recipe as if they were talking to a professional chef. Every script will run a different version of the ChefGPT with an entirely different personality.

## Prerequisites

Run the following command in the terminal with Python 3

```
pip install openai
```

Obtain an OpenAI key and run the following command

```
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_key>
```

## How to run

Locate the main folder and execute

```
python main.py
```

Follow the instructions on the terminal and select a script to run. The following are the available options:

1. 2vJSPK - Jesus Vera.
2. tJ5Mon - Sofia Orellano.

After selecting the script to execute, please follow the instructions to continue using it.

Enjoy!
