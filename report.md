# Weekend project report

8. Experiment passing a list of ingredients for one script, then ask another script for a recipe for that dish, and then criticize the recipe given by the last script with a third script
9. Create a report with the results of the experiment and the different outputs of the AI chefs

## Introduction
The project aims to develop AI chef scripts with distinct personalities to handle various culinary tasks such as suggesting dishes based on ingredients, providing recipes, and critiquing recipes. This report summarizes the experiments conducted using different AI chef scripts and their integration into a cohesive system.

The report is based on 3 experiments:
1. Passing a list of ingredients for one script (ChefGTP_tJ5Mon)
2. Asking another script for a recipe for that dish (ChefGPT_2vJSPK)
3. Criticizing the recipe given by the last script with a third script (Aleksandar Brayanov's script)

Just a friendly reminder in terms of sustainability, try to source your ingredients locally, especially the bananas, butter, and eggs. Supporting local producers helps reduce environmental impact and fosters a stronger community. Is there anything else you would like to ask or any other recipe you need help with?

how should i source my bananas locally because im living in the north of england?
Sourcing bananas locally in the north of England may be a bit challenging due to climate limitations, as bananas primarily grow in tropical regions. However, supporting local farmers and producers by choosing locally grown products whenever possible is still a great way to contribute to sustainability.

Instead of looking for local bananas, you can explore other delicious and more sustainable options that are locally produced and in season in the north of England. Fruits like apples, pears, blackberries, raspberries, plums, and rhubarb are commonly grown in the region. You can use these fruits in various bakes, desserts, and dishes that showcase the local flavors and support nearby farmers.

When it comes to bananas, try to opt for Fairtrade or organic bananas at your local grocery store. Fairtrade bananas ensure fair wages and sustainable practices for the farmers who grow them. Choosing organic bananas supports environmentally friendly farming methods that promote soil health and biodiversity.

Would you like to explore a recipe using locally available ingredients from the North of England such as apples or blackberries, or do you have any other questions or requests for recipes?
