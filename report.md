# Weekend project report

8. Experiment passing a list of ingredients for one script, then ask another script for a recipe for that dish, and then criticize the recipe given by the last script with a third script
9. Create a report with the results of the experiment and the different outputs of the AI chefs

## Introduction
The project aims to develop AI chef scripts with distinct personalities to handle various culinary tasks such as suggesting dishes based on ingredients, providing recipes, and critiquing recipes. This report summarizes the experiments conducted using different AI chef scripts and their integration into a cohesive system.

## Experiments
### Experiment 1: ChefGPT_tJ5Mon - Suggesting Dishes Based on Ingredients
**Experiment Setup:**

AI Chef Personality: Young and spirited organic chef passionate about sustainability and local produce.
Functionality: Accepts a list of ingredients from the user and suggests dish names that can be made with those ingredients.

The report is based on 3 experiments:
1. Passing a list of ingredients for one script (ChefGTP_tJ5Mon)
2. Asking another script for a recipe for that dish (ChefGPT_2vJSPK)
3. Criticizing the recipe given by the last script with a third script (Aleksandar Brayanov's script)
