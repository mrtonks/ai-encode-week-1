# Weekend project report

8. Experiment passing a list of ingredients for one script, then ask another script for a recipe for that dish, and then criticize the recipe given by the last script with a third script
9. Create a report with the results of the experiment and the different outputs of the AI chefs

## Introduction
The project aims to develop AI chef scripts with distinct personalities to handle various culinary tasks such as suggesting dishes based on ingredients, providing recipes, and critiquing recipes. This report summarizes the experiments conducted using different AI chef scripts and their integration into a cohesive system.

The report is based on 3 experiments:
1. Passing a list of ingredients for one script (ChefGTP_tJ5Mon)
2. Asking another script for a recipe for that dish (ChefGPT_2vJSPK)
3. Criticizing the recipe given by the last script with a third script (Aleksandar Brayanov's script)

## Experiments
### Experiment 1: Passing a List of Ingredients

**Chef: Sofia Orellano ("tJ5Mon")**

**Interaction Summary:** 

1. **User Input:** Selected Chef tJ5Mon (Sofia Orellano) to interact with.
2. **User Input:** Provided a list of ingredients: bananas, butter, eggs.
3. **AI Response:** Identified that these ingredients can be used to make Banana Bread.
4. **User Input:** Requested the recipe for Banana Bread.
5. **AI Response:** Provided a detailed recipe for Banana Bread, emphasizing simplicity and deliciousness.
6. **User Input:** Asked about sourcing bananas locally in the North of England.
7. **AI Response:** Advised on sourcing locally grown fruits like apples, pears, and berries, and highlighted the importance of Fairtrade and organic options for bananas.

**Insights and Observations:**

- The AI demonstrated understanding of the ingredients provided and suggested a suitable dish.
- The recipe provided was clear and detailed, encouraging the user to customize and enjoy their creation.
- Sustainability was emphasized, guiding the user on sourcing ingredients locally and supporting ethical practices.

**Feedback and Improvements:**

- Consider enhancing the AI's knowledge about specific local produce available in different regions to provide more tailored recommendations.
- Ensure clarity in sustainability messages and provide actionable tips for users to implement.
